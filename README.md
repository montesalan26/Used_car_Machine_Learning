# Used_car_Machine_Learning
This project was created using Jupyter Notebook. In this project, I used different types of machine learning models, including gradient boosting, catboost, and lightgbm to predict used car prices from a dataset. I took the features from the dataset and the price column as the target to make those predictions using the Root Mean Squared Error metric to evaluate those machine learning models. Also, I used the %%time Magic Command in Jupyter Notebook to see the execution time of each machine learning model, being able to determine a machine learning model with a good execution time and good quality also.
