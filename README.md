# Used_car_Machine_Learning
In this project, I used different types of machine learning models, including gradient boosting, catboost, and lightgbm to predict used car prices from a dataset. I took the features from the dataset and the price column as the target to make those predictions using the Root Mean Squared Error metric to evaluate those machine learning models
